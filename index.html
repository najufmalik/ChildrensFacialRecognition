			<p>	From an early age and throughout oneâ€™s lifespan, emotional skills are essential to communicate our emotions to others and adapt our behavior according to both our internal feelings and the reactions of those around us. Understanding how we feel and showing empathy towards others are essential skills for individuals of any age. Visual signals, such as facial expressions, are crucial components for people to understand as emotional signals. For children, understanding facial expressions and developing empathy for others are crucial for their social-communication development. However, children with Autism Spectrum Conditions (ASC) have major difficulties in detecting and recognizing the emotional and mental states of other people's facial expressions (Baron-Cohen). <br/>
			<br>The problem that we are trying to tackle involves deducing human emotions, but specifically, detecting what facial expressions represent in terms of how an individual may feel is not considered an easy task. Our focus will be on specifically assisting children with Autism Spectrum Conditions (ASC) to learn how to detect facial expressions in their parents and peers of all races and genders. While our focus is on children, anyone would be able to use this to learn about facial expressions and what they represent.  </br>
