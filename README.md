# Computer-Vision-Project

Our goal of this project in the end was to test modern tools of facial/emotion recognition on children's faces, in order to help those who have Autism Spectrum Condition (ASC) better familiarize themselves with the emotions portrayed around them. 

This is important as it can be much more difficult to detect facial expressions without training over time and a tool that could help them distinguish between facial expressions of their peers or older adults could very easily benefit their level of comfort in social situations as they get older.
